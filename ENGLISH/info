This repository contains all the Jupyter Notebook files of the Python codes, as well as the extra files used in the book "Learning Chemistry with Python, Rodrigo Q. de Albuquerque & Gerd B. da Rocha, Amazon Book, 2021". Notice that some files used in certain chapters are not directly provided in this repository as separate files, but generated on-the-fly after the execution of some cells in the corresponding Jupyter Notebook file of those chapters.
